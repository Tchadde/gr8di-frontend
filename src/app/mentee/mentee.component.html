          <p class="description" style="text-align:justify;">This program is meant for students in Cameroon who have taken a course form @kraulain and have less than 1 year of Groovy experience. After taking the weekend courses in the Groovy languages, you may want to do small projects, start small businesses, or try to start remote jobs using Groovy and that can be difficult to do on your own. Several senior members of the Groovy community have offered to help you continue to learn and become Groovy experts! As a mentee, you would have the opportunity to ask basic questions, ask your mentor for resources or tutorials, and have rare skype or other screen sharing video calls to help debug through complex problems. After the first round (approximately 6 weeks), we will take feedback from the students and mentors to create a suggested program for learning Groovy. We also ask that you agree to follow our code of conduct and only ask questions that are Groovy (or project) related and let the mentors take their time to answer you. Some of our mentors work during the day and may only be available in the evenings for example. If you have questions that need immediate answers, you can always ask in the Groovy slack or on stack overflow.</p>
