        <p class="description" style="text-align:justify;">A growing number of university students in various cities in the country of Cameroon have been taking classes (or have signed up for classes) to learn Groovy from local expert @Kraulain. Some students have programming experience with other languages and some have never programmed before. After taking the weekend courses, students do small projects, start small businesses, or try to find remote jobs using Groovy. They can use our help to continue to learn and become Groovy experts! As a mentor, you would answer basic questions, suggest resources or tutorials for them, and have rare skype or other screen sharing video calls to help debug through complex problems. After the first round (approximately 6 weeks), we will take feedback from the students and mentors to create a suggested program for learning Groovy. We'll also provide a forum to ask questions of the other mentors and ask that you(and the mentees) follow our code of conduct.
